\begin{inspiration}
 With the restoration of geometry to its rightful place in the mathematical scheme the process of fragmentation which had been doing so much harm to mathematics has been reversed, and we may look forward to the day in which there are no longer analysts, algebraists, geometers and so on, but simply mathematicians.

\section{Terminology}

\begin{problem}
 What is the Euler characteristic $\chi(M)$ of a smooth manifold $M$? 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
What is a K\"ahler manifold?

\section{Numericals}

\begin{problem} The map $\star \circ \star$ is multiplication by $\pm
1$.  Determine the sign.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Show that the Laplacian $\Delta : \Omega^k(\R^n) \to \Omega^k(\R^n)$  satisfies
  \[
    \Delta \left( f \, dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k} \right) = \pm \left( \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{\partial f}{\partial {x_{i_j}}^2} \right) \, dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}

\section{Exploration}

\begin{problem} For an oriented closed $n$-manifold $M$, show that
$\omega \in \Omega^k(M)$ is harmonic if and if only if $\star \omega
\in \Omega^{n-k}(M)$ is harmonic.

\section{Prove or Disprove and Salvage if Possible (PODASIP)}

\begin{problem} % orientable
 For a smooth $(4n+2)$-manifold $M$, the Euler characteristic $\chi(M)$ is even.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  For oriented closed manifolds $M$, $N$, consider the product $M \times N$ with projection maps $p_1 : M \times N \to M$ and $p_2 : M \times N \to N$.

  The map
  \[
    {p_1}^\star \otimes {p_2}^\star : \sum_{i+j = k} H_{dR}^i(M) \otimes H_{dR}^j(N) \to H_{dR}^k(M \times N)
  \]
  is injective.
