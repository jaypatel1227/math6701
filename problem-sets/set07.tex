harpoon of algebraic topology into the body of the whale of algebraic
geometry. But I must not push the metaphor too far.  \byline{Solomon

\textbf{Scheduling note:} To celebrate the Fall Break, this homework is now due October 22. 

\section{Terminology}

\begin{problem} Let $M, N$ be connected, oriented, closed smooth
$n$-manifolds. \\ For a smooth map $f : M \to N$, what is the
\textbf{degree} of the map $f$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
 Define $H_c^k(M)$, de Rham cohomology with compact support. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Again let $M, N$ be connected, oriented, closed smooth $n$-manifolds.\\  What is the \textbf{connected sum} of $M$ and $N$, written $M \# N$?
\end{problem}

\section{Numericals}

\begin{problem}
Compute $H_{\dR}^k(\Sigma_g)$.  Recall that $\Sigma_g = T^2 \# \cdots \# T^2$ with $g$ copies of the torus $T^2$.
\end{problem}

\section{Exploration}

\begin{problem} For a closed, connected, oriented manifold $M$, our
solution to \ref{degree-one-to-sphere} produced a degree one map $M
\to S^n$. \\[1ex]  Is there necessarily a degree one map $S^n \to M$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} In \ref{no-retraction}, we saw that there is no
retraction of a disk onto its boundary.  \\[1ex] For a connected,
oriented, compact, smooth manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$, is
there a retraction of $M$ onto $\partial M$?
\end{problem}

\section{Prove or Disprove and Salvage if Possible (PODASIP)}

\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be the disjoint union of countably many points.
  Then
 \[H^0(X \times X) \cong H^0(X) \otimes H^0(X).\]
This is Example~9.14 from Bott--Tu.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} % salvage to connected
If the smooth $n$-manifold $M$ is not orientable, then $H_{\dR}^n(M) = 0$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} For a map $f : M \to N$, there are induced maps
$f^\star : H_c^k(N) \to H_c^k(M)$ and $f_\star : H_c^k(M) \to
H_c^k(N)$.
\end{problem} % proper maps pullback, covariant for inclusions
