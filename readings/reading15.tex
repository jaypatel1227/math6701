From Morita's \textit{Geometry of Differential Forms}, read
\begin{itemize}
\item 6.1 Fiber bundle and principal bundle
\item 6.2 $S^1$ bundles and Euler classes
\item 6.3 Connections
\end{itemize} This material introduces \textbf{principal bundles},
which are not \textit{principle} but rather \textit{principal} in the
sense of ``first in order of importance.''  What exactly is principal
about a principal bundle?

A principal $\GL(V)$-bundle gives rise to an associated vector bundle,
so in that sense, these $\GL(V)$-bundles are the ``main'' object, with
the vector bundles somehow being produced from the principal bundles.
And these principal bundles have some significant advantages: we were
angry that the connection 1-form did not transform tensorially, but
for principal bundles, the connection 1-forms are honest, globally
defined 1-forms.

There are other advantages: not every fiber bundle has vector space
fibers, so armed with the notion of principal $G$-bundles, we can not
only recover the story for vector bundles (through these
``associated'' bundles) but also discuss examples beyond vector
bundles, like circle bundles.

Finally, thinking about principal $G$-bundles will enable us to
consider ``reduction of structure'' and the various relationships
between $G$-bundles and $H$-bundles.  We've seen examples of this
(like the relationship between bundles with transtiion maps in
$\GL(V)$ versus those with transition maps in $\SO(V)$) so this
framework will help us understand the situation more generally.
