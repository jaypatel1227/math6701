\maketitle

At the end of last week, we saw tangent vectors and recognized how we
could use those tangent vectors to do calculus, compute derivatives,
and ultimately define ``embeddings'' and verify that our
abstractly-built manifolds via charts give rise to the same objects as
embedded manifolds.

This week, we assemble tangent vectors together into \textbf{vector
  fields}, which are \textit{sections of the tangent bundle} meaning
that those tangent spaces $T_p M$ also can be assembled together into
the tangent bundle $TM$.  Think back to vector fields in a
differential equations course, and recall how useful it was to
consider both a point and a vector at the same time, i.e., for setting
up initial conditions.

From Morita's \textit{Geometry of Differential Forms}, read
\begin{itemize}
\item 1.4 Vector fields
\end{itemize}
Vector fields provide some fun examples; the homework will encourage
you to think about vector fields on $S^2$.  And with a notion of
vector fields, we can also discuss \textbf{orientation} to determine
when a local notion of handedness can be extended over a manifold.
And if tangent bundles let us do linear algebra over a manifold, then
thinking about orientations suggests doing multilinear algebra over a
manifold---exactly why next week's theme is exterior algebra.
