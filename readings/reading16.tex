\maketitle

Our course ends with us reprising Week 13 (on characteristic classes
for vector bundle) in the nicer context of principle G-bundles.  This
means looking at the end of Chapter 6, i.e.,
\begin{itemize}
\item 6.4 Curvature
\item 6.5 Characteristic classes
\end{itemize}
from Morita's \textit{Geometry of Differential Forms}.

It has been a true honor being one of your guides through differential
manifolds.  With the pandemic, this has been my first in-person
teaching experience in a long while, so our time together has
highlighted the value of meeting together to do mathematics.  I hope
your future studies provide you plenty of opportunities to dig deeper
into manifolds.
