\maketitle

Our course ends with us reprising Week 13 (on characteristic classes
for vector bundle) in the nicer context of principle $G$-bundles.  This
means looking at the end of Chapter 6, i.e.,
\begin{itemize}
\item 6.4 Curvature
\item 6.5 Characteristic classes
\end{itemize}
from Morita's \textit{Geometry of Differential Forms}.

Recall that there are two different ways of thinking about a
connection: there is a geometric approach via horizontal lifts, but
then there is a more algebraic approach via differential forms.  Armed
with the connection form, we can compute a curvature form, and with a
curvature form, we can produce characteristic classes.

It has been a true honor being one of your guides through differential
manifolds.  With the pandemic, this has been my first in-person
teaching experience in a long while, so our time together has
highlighted the value of meeting together to do mathematics.  I hope
your future studies provide you plenty of opportunities to dig deeper
into manifolds.
